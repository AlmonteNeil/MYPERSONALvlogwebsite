        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Neil Almonte, productivity tools play a big role in helping me manage
          my daily task or school requirments and one tool that I will not leave behind is
          Canva because in making or designing presentations or reports it is easier to
          making designs or if you do not have some strong graphic design skills its very
          efficient and another tool that I cannot leave behind is also google Workspace,
          especially Google Docs and Google Drive, because it allow me to use it in anywhere
          and collaborate with classmates for free and very easy to use.

        </p>
        <h3>Main content</h3>
        <h4><li>How AI Is Impacting IT Lives Today</li></h4>
        <p>
            There are many changes being brought about in the current IT students and professionals by Artificial Intelligence.
            There is the use of chatbots and code suggestion systems. This is the use of Artificial Intelligence in improving the
            processes of problem-solving and learning. For a learner like me, I consider Artificial Intelligence as a helper a
            well as a challenge because of the impact of this technology in making work easier as well as being used carefully.
            It encourages IT students to be less reliant on memorizations.
        </p>

        <h4><li>The Programming Language That Challenges Me the Most</li></h4>
          <p>
                Each student in the IT field has to face at one time or another those programming languages that seem to
                be difficult at the very beginning. As for me, a difficult language means a language that requires strict
                syntax and strong logical thinking, like C++ or Java. Such languages can be an irritant because often, with
                just a tiny mistake, numerous difficult-to-locate errors turn up. At the same time, such a challenge consolidates
                my problem-solving skills and teaches me to be more patient. When the time goes by, with every difficult language
                I had struggled with, I become more confident as a learner.
          </p>
        <h4><li>Coding vs Typing: The Truth About IT Programming</li></h4>
        <p>
            Many believe that programming on the IT level means only typing fast, but from my experience, programming
            means much more than typing, as programming involves not only typing but understanding the logic of programming,
            planning, and step-by-step breakdown of problems. Typing only takes a minor part of the entire process, while the
            breakdown of problems takes most of the time, so this experience taught me that a programmer does not have to be fast
            but clear-minded.
        </p>
        <h4><li>Conclusion</li></h4>
        <p>
          Technology impacts the lives of IT students in a number of ways, whether it be the technology we apply,
          the skills we learn, or the applications we develop. Productivity suites allow us to remain organized,
          artificial intelligence disrupts the methods we apply to learn, and coding challenges serve to help us
          improve. The one concept that has been made clear to me thus far is the applicability of technology,
          as I believe that it goes beyond simple tools, application, or language.
