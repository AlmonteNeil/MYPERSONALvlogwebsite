        <h2>Chasing Goals On and Off the Field</h2>
        <p>
            Bilang isang college student, hindi madali ang pagsabayin ang academics at football training.
            May mga araw na tinatanong ko ang sarili ko kung kakayanin ko ba ang mga deadlines sa school
            habang nagbibigay din ng oras at effort sa training. This blog shares my personal experience
            as a student-athlete and how I manage both education and my passion for football.
        </p>

        <h2>The Balancing Act of School and Football</h2>

        <h3>Life as a Student and playing football</h3>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581092795368-0210d6a7b5a1"

             class="small-img">
        <p>
            Being a college student while actively training in football requires discipline and sacrifice.
            Pagkatapos ng training, madalas pagod na ang katawan ko pero kailangan ko pa ring mag-aral,
            gumawa ng projects, at mag-review para sa exams. Through this experience, natutunan kong
            ayusin ang oras ko at maging responsable sa aking priorities.
        </p>

        <h3>The Skills That Will Shape My Football Journey</h3>

             class="small-img">
        <p>
            Football taught me important life skills such as discipline, teamwork, consistency, and mental
            toughness. These skills are not only useful on the field but also inside the classroom.
            Natutunan kong mag-set ng goals at magpatuloy kahit nahihirapan, which helps me grow as both
            a student and an athlete.
        </p>

        <h3>What Coaches Look for in Student Football Players</h3>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599058917212-9f37c5bb7d13"
             alt="Coaches Looking at Players"
             class="small-img">
        <p>
            Based on my observation, coaches value attitude and commitment as much as talent.
            Mahalaga ang respeto, discipline, at willingness to learn. As a student-athlete, I aim to show
            that I can balance academics and sports, proving that responsibility and passion can go together.
        </p>

        <h3>My Dream Football Project</h3>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599058917212-1a2b3c4d5e6f"
             alt="Dream Football Project"
             class="small-img">
        <p>
            My dream is to be part of a football program that supports both education and athletic development.
            I want to help create opportunities for students who want to pursue football without sacrificing
            their studies. Through this, I hope to inspire others to chase their passion while staying committed
            to their education.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflections on the Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Managing school and football training at the same time is challenging, but it has taught me valuable
            lessons about discipline and perseverance. My biggest realization is that I do not have to choose
            between education and football. With proper time management and dedication, I can work hard for both
            and continue building my future as a student-athlete.
