    <p>
              I was born in Caloocan City on December 2, 2003.<sup>1</sup>
        My childhood was not easy because of the challenges my family faced.<sup>2</sup>
        When I was only two years old, my parents separated due to personal problems.<sup>3</sup>
        Because of that situation, my grandparents became the ones who raised me.<sup>4</sup>
        They welcomed me with love even though life was difficult.<sup>5</sup>
        I grew up in an environment where we didn’t have much, but we always had each other.<sup>6</sup>
        My grandparents taught me the value of hard work.<sup>7</sup>
        They also taught me the importance of kindness and respect.<sup>8</sup>
        Life with them was simple but meaningful.<sup>9</sup>
        We lived in Palanan, Isabela where my grandparents had settled.<sup>10</sup>
        That town became my new home full of memories.<sup>11</sup>
        Doon ako unang natutong makibagay sa simpleng pamumuhay.<sup>12</sup>
        I learned how to appreciate little things even when times were tough.<sup>13</sup>
        Dito ko rin natutunan na ang pagmamahal ay hindi nasusukat sa materyal na bagay.<sup>14</sup>
        I studied in Palanan from elementary until high school.<sup>15</sup>
        My school became my second home because of the friends I met.<sup>16</sup>
        My teachers in Palanan also helped shape my character.<sup>17</sup>
        Growing up with my grandparents made me stronger.<sup>18</sup>
        Their sacrifices inspired me to dream bigger.<sup>19</sup>
        My childhood, though difficult, became the foundation of who I am today.<sup>20</sup>

        Then in my teenage years, I started to fall in love with computers.<sup>1</sup>
        I became very curious about how computers worked and how everything inside them functioned.<sup>2</sup>
        I would often wonder how programs were made and how technology kept improving.<sup>3</sup>
        Pero dahil sa kahirapan ng buhay, hindi ko alam kung paano ako makakaangat.<sup>4</sup>
        There were moments when I felt lost because of the challenges I faced.<sup>5</sup>
        Sometimes I questioned if I would ever reach the dreams I had in mind.<sup>6</sup>
        As a teenager, I carried a lot of questions about life.<sup>7</sup>
        One of the biggest questions I had was about my mother.<sup>8</sup>
        I often wondered why she left and what really happened to us.<sup>9</sup>
        Madalas ko ring tanungin sa sarili ko kung bakit niya ako iniwan.<sup>10</sup>
        Those thoughts made my teenage years emotionally heavy.<sup>11</sup>
        But despite the confusion and sadness, I found strength in the people around me.<sup>12</sup>
        My titas and titos always showed me love in their own ways.<sup>13</sup>
        They made me feel that I was never alone.<sup>14</sup>
        Lalo na ang lolo at lola ko na hindi nagsawang gabayan ako.<sup>15</sup>
        Their love filled the empty spaces that I used to worry about.<sup>16</sup>
        They reminded me that family is not only about who stayed but also about who chose to love you.<sup>17</sup>
        Because of them, I slowly learned to accept my situation.<sup>18</sup>
        I realized that even though life was difficult, I was surrounded by love.<sup>19</sup>
        My teenage years became a time of pain, discovery, and quiet strength.<sup>20</sup>

    <p>
        In my college life, I experienced one of the most transformative moments of my journey.<sup>1</sup>
        College opened my world in ways I never expected.<sup>2</sup>
        Madami akong nakilala at halos bawat tao na nakasalamuha ko ay may sariling kwento.<sup>3</sup>
        Most of the people I met had unique stories about their IT life.<sup>4</sup>
        Some had habits and routines that inspired me to improve.<sup>5</sup>
        During my first year, everything felt chaotic because the environment was so new.<sup>6</sup>
        It was hard for me to adjust at first.<sup>7</sup>
        Mahirap din makipagkaibigan sa mga taong hindi ko pa kilala.<sup>8</sup>
        But even with the fear and uncertainty, I still tried my best.<sup>9</sup>
        I pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone.<sup>10</sup>
        I wanted to prove that I could handle the challenges ahead.<sup>11</sup>
        Little by little, I broke the limitations I once placed on myself.<sup>12</sup>
        Madami akong natutunan na bago pagdating sa coding.<sup>13</sup>
        My skills slowly developed even if the progress was small.<sup>14</sup>
        Each small improvement reminded me to keep going.<sup>15</sup>
        I survived my first year without any major problems.<sup>16</sup>
        Every semester taught me something new about life.<sup>17</sup>
        I felt proud knowing I was slowly working toward my dreams.<sup>18</sup>
        My college journey made me appreciate how far I’ve come.<sup>19</sup>
        College became not just an education, but a journey of growth and purpose.<sup>20</sup>
